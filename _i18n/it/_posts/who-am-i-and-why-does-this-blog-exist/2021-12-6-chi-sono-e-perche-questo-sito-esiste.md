Hello there! :wave:

These are two good questions, let's start with...

# Who am I? :seedling:

I was born in [Naples](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoli) in February 2001 and my first steps in the programming world begin before the end of elementary schools thanks to a crappy PC :computer: and to the few forums that there were on the web at the time :spider_web:.

Thanks to forums and to their tutorials I learned slowly the basic principles of information technology. I developed small projects :computer_mouse: to practice and meanwhile I studied everything that could help me at that time to overcome obstacles.

Today I'm twenty years old and I'm working as a developer at [Kotuko](https://www.kotuko.it/) and bringing forward some [projects](/my-projects/) in my free time.

# Why does this blog exist? :computer:

Sharing knowledge has always been important. Since my first steps, tutorials have been fundamental to overcome obstacles and avoid headaches :face_with_head_bandage:. 

It still happens to me to run into obstacles, It will always happen to everyone because It is part of the deal, but we have the sharing on our side that helps us to overcome it.

Sharing knowledge is so powerful and just like the others, I want to be part of this network and share anything that could help someone. :butterfly:

# That's all!

I hope that I have answered your questions, if you would like you can add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agostinofiscale/).

See you around! :rose:
